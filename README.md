# Metro-Planner-App
A mobile application project for my CS4237 (Software Design for Handheld Devices) Course written in Kotlin in the Spring 2020 Semester.

# Libraries/APIs Used
- Google Plays Services 
    - Google Maps/Geocoding
- Square's OkHttp Library

# Project Description
Given a user's location and certain preferences, the Application utilizes the WMATA Metro API as well as the Yelp Businesses API in order to display a map with a number of related attractions/restaurants centered around a location and provides the nearest Metro stop (if the target location is within the WMATA service area).

# Testing Instructions
If you would like to test the application for yourself, you can download the ``` app_debug.apk ``` file and install it on a physical device over USB or on a virtualized device.
